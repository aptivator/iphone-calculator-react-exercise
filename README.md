# iphone-calculator-react-exercise

## Introduction

The purpose of this exercise is to code a precise replica of iOS 18.5
simple calculator (see sample images [here](./source-images/)).  This
web-based implementation written using React supports nearly all
functionality such as operations stacking based on operator precedence,
selective clearing of values, computational shortcuts, continuous
calculations, and all of the default features.

## Prerequisites

A modern browser is required.  Container units are employed to make the
application visually scalable by changing only its height.  The calculator
was tested and rendered as expected in the latest Google Chrome, Mozilla
Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers.

## Launch Instructions

* `git clone https://github.com/aptivator/iphone-calculator-react-exercise.git`
* `cd iphone-calculator-react-exercise`
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`
* go to `http://localhost:5173/` in a modern browser of choice
